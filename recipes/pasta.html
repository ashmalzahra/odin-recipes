    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Incredibly simple pasta with cauliflower, but very flavorful. Reheats well.</p>


    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 head cauliflower, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>1 pound penne pasta</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped, or to taste</li>
        <li>1½ cups chopped black olives</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon shredded basil leaves</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the
            steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add cauliflower, cover, and steam until tender but not mushy,
            4 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, 
            stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes.</li>
        <li>While pasta boils, heat olive oil in another large pot over medium heat. Add garlic and 
            saute briefly, 1 to 2 minutes. Do not brown. Add chopped olives. Saute to heat through, 
            3 to 4 minutes. Add basil and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Add steamed cauliflower to the olive mixture. Mix well. Mash cauliflower slightly with a
            potato masher, leaving some florets intact. Serve over drained pasta. Top with Parmesan 
            cheese and red pepper flakes.</li>
    </ol>
